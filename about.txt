A few words about me...

I am 20 years old self-taught programmer focused on Front-end Web Development.






After finishing Bussiness Academy I firstly decided to study at University of
Economics in Prague. Every day I asked myself: "Is that what I really want?".
I left the university and started to learn programming. I found a lot of useful
informations on the Internet especially on YouTube, FreeCodeCamp, Udemy,
W3School, etc.
